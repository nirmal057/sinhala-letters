# 🔬 Sinhala Handwriting Recognition Research Documentation
## CNN vs HMM Comparative Study for Children Aged 6-10

### 📋 Research Overview

**Title:** "A Comparative Study of CNN and HMM Models for Recognizing Sinhala Handwritten Characters by Children Aged 6–10, with Educational Application to Improve Letter Writing Skills"

**Objective:** To compare the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) versus Hidden Markov Models (HMM) in recognizing Sinhala handwritten characters produced by children, and develop an educational web application that improves letter writing skills.

### 🎯 Research Questions

1. **Primary Question:** Which model (CNN vs HMM) provides better accuracy for recognizing Sinhala handwritten characters by children aged 6-10?

2. **Secondary Questions:**
   - How does recognition accuracy vary across different age groups (6, 7, 8, 9, 10)?
   - Which model provides more suitable real-time feedback for educational purposes?
   - What are the most commonly confused letter pairs by age group?
   - How does model performance correlate with children's writing improvement over time?

### 👶 Target Demographics

**Primary Target:** Children aged 6-10 years learning Sinhala script

**Age-Specific Characteristics:**
- **Ages 6-7:** Large motor skills, need bigger writing spaces, basic shape recognition
